# Platform changelog
### UI v10.152.0 (2024/09/23)

- update activity view url

### DevCenter v0.253.0 (2024/09/23)
The method for calculating lines of code has changed slightly. We now count raw file lines. This is much quicker (as we can use this information from the LST) and this results better DevCenter performance.

### UI v10.151.0 (2024/09/17)

- Bug fixes and other improvements.

### DevCenter v0.250.0 (2024/09/13)
DevCenter API versioning is introduced to allow admins to configure a new version of DevCenter.
Using version `1` allows the use of the DevCenter’s upgrades and migrations section to treat repositories with no results as “N/A” instead of Completed/Compliant.

#### Why are these changes being made?

These changes to the DevCenter provide more visibility to users, specifically for which repos they should care about completing the upgrade/migration, and which ones aren’t important for this upgrade/migration. Imagine an organization cares about the Spring Boot 3 upgrade and has 75 Java repositories (50 on the latest Spring Boot and 25 on older versions) and 25 non-Java repositories. In the current implementation of DevCenter, users would see 50% completed, even though 25 of those repositories don’t even use Java. After this set of changes, users will now see “N/A” for repositories that are not important to the migration.

#### Changes required to use this feature
If you want to use this feature you will have to set the version to `1` and add a new “measure” to your DevCenter configuration. Take a look at [this commit](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-organizations/commit/7515890c9f2b7730423db56e26dc7577b1b095f9) in moderne-organizations for an example. If your upgrades and migrations do not include the ones mentioned here and you need help identifying the recipe for the “completed” measure, please feel free to email us at support@moderne.io.


### UI v10.150.0 (2024/09/12)

#### Builder

We have added a recent recipes tab to the recipe finder dialog.  Starting now whenever you add a recipe node in the builder or go to a recipe's details page in the marketplace that recipe will be added to your recent recipes list.  This list currently will retain the last 25 recipes for quick access:

### UI v10.149.0 (2024/09/12)

#### Builder

The speed dial actions on the 3D topology view can get pretty busy especially when the layout and the view is in the sidebar.  We have consolidated Add precondition and Add recipe into a single option similar to the tree item controls:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This action will still take you to the recipe finder dialog which will allow you to add the recipe as a precondition by manually checking the precondition checkbox.

### UI v10.148.0 (2024/09/10)

#### Builder

We improved the performance of the recipe tree and dramatically improved the drag and drop behavior to reorder nodes:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/drag and drop.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v10.147.0 (2024/09/09)

* add category icons to quick search

### UI v10.146.0 (2024/09/05)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.145.1 (2024/08/30)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.145.0 (2024/08/30)

#### Builder

We have added new tabs to the recipe finder dialog that is presented when adding a recipe to the currently selected node. The default tab is _Marketplace recipes_ and provides the same experience users have already become familiar with. There is also a tab for _Builder recipes_ to allow users to select one of their custom recipes\_:\_\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (66).png>)

Selecting one will make a copy of the recipe in its current form and add it to the currently selected node similar to selecting one of the marketplace recipes. This including toggling it to be added as a precondition.

### UI v10.144.0 (2024/08/27)

#### Builder

We have added a toggle-able help panel with a color legend and topology control scheme:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (65).png>)

### UI v10.143.0 (2024/08/22)

#### Builder

Previously using the search and filter would allow you to find recipes by name but unfortunately in cases where a recipe is used many times you will get results like this:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (64).png>)

In efforts to address this the search and filter feature is now aware of option input values and will take these into consideration:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (63).png>)

### UI v10.142.0 (2024/08/21)

#### Builder

Often a custom recipe will be composed of a few recipes that are used many times with different options. We have heard feedback that going through the recipe selection dialog becomes tedious for this work. In response we have added a duplicate button that will clone the recipe node as a sibling node. If the recipe duplicated has options then the edit options dialog will open automatically after duplicating:

### UI v10.141.0 (2024/08/16)

* handle 401 errors where accessToken is still unexpired

### UI v10.140.0 (2024/08/15)

#### Builder

In efforts to provide more details in dialog we needed more space we have changed the builder dialogs so that they are the width of the main content area and positioned accordingly:\
![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (5).png>)

We have improved recipe selector so that the recipe description is visible to give the added context to users when constructing recipes:

![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (4).png>)

### UI v10.139.2 (2024/08/09)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.139.1 (2024/08/09)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.139.0 (2024/08/07)

We have added a new visualization mime type:

`application/vnd.moderne.yamlrecipe+json`

This new mime type allows visualization notebook authors the ability to generate and then provide a base64 encoded yaml recipe as output. The resulting visualization in Moderne will be the yaml recipe rendered in an editor with a recipe dry run button ready for users to use. An example can be found in the [find\_methods\_ai\_generte\_yaml.ipynb](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne\_visualizations\_misc/find\_methods\_ai\_generate\_yaml.ipynb) notebook.

### UI v10.138.0 (2024/08/07)

* add new category logos for ff4j, OpenFeature, and Unleash to support the new feature flag recipes\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (3).png>)

### UI v10.137.0 (2024/08/05)

### UI v10.133.0 (2024/07/29)

We have added more quality of life improvements for the new builder:

* add builder keyboard shortcuts\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (57) (1).png>)
* the speed dial menu previously opened on hover but closed on click which made for a few variations of weird interactions. We have changed the menu so it must be clicked to open and clicked to close making the experience predictable and consistent. The speed dial menu also has a new icon:\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (58).png>)
* improve builder options' readability and spacing on larger screens
* Bug fixes and other improvements.

UI v10.132.1 (2024/07/25)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.132.0 (2024/07/25)

In this release we have made various improvements to the new builder to increase clarity and productivity.

* Since adding controls such as **add**, **edit**, **delete** to the tree view ([v10.124.0](https://docs.moderne.io/releases/changelog#ui-v10.124.0-2024-06-20)) we found some users enjoy primarily using the tree view to compose recipes so we want to allow users to move this view to the main content window. There is now a new layout swap icon to swap the 3D topology view and the tree view:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/layout_swap.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* We received feedback that the options were hard to discover. We have begun to address this by making the options panel auto open when the selected recipe has options and also auto expand to fit more options before having to scroll. Note the options have moved to the lower right now:\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (2) (4).png>)
* We found that some users were not aware of the recipe menu and the options available there so we have made the button more visible by adding a label:\
  <img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (3) (1).png" alt="" data-size="original">

### UI v10.131.0 (2024/07/22)

* improve builder tree font on large displays

### UI v10.130.0 (2024/07/18)

*   In the builder there is now a new menu item **Edit as YAML**\
    This will open a text editor with the current recipe's yaml to edit:

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (57).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>
* In the builder you can now edit nest recipe details

### UI v10.129.0 (2024/07/16)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.128.4 (2024/07/11)

  * In combination with other backend changes we now expose more data tables when running composite recipes. Find more information on the latest visualization package [here](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

### UI v10.128.2 (2024/07/09)

### UI v10.125.0 (2024/06/26)

* In order to demonstrate how complete an impact analysis or set of changes is, we have added results for all repositories to the recipe run results, this now includes repositories for which we have no LST ingested into the platform.

### UI v10.124.1 (2024/06/23)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.124.0 (2024/06/20)

### UI v10.121.2 (2024/06/12)

* Bug fixes and other improvements.

### UI v10.121.0 (2024/06/11)

* In the new builder we have improved the default recipe ID only in private customer tenants. The new default ID will be based off the user's email. Example:
  * `jsmith@superco.com` -> `com.superco.jsmith.Untitled`
  * `j.smith@superco.ai` -> `ai.superco.j_smith.Untitled`
*   The new builder now supports adding preconditions to any recipe node.\
    \
    Preconditions are recipes that run before the current list of recipes. When a recipe is used as a precondition, any file that it would make a change to is considered to meet the precondition. When more than one recipe is used as a precondition, all of them must make a change to the file for it to be considered to meet the precondition.

    Only when all preconditions are met will the recipes in the recipe list be run.

    \
    _For more information, please see our_ [_preconditions documentation_](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/how-to-guides/preconditions)_._\
    \
    Preconditions can be added via a new button:\
    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (46).png>)\
    or when adding a recipe by toggling this check box:\
    ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (47).png>)\
    \
    Preconditions show up as a different color node in the 3D scene and highlighted in the tree view:

    <figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (48).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v10.120.0 (2024/06/04)

* include bearer token with share curl from graphiql editor

### UI v10.119.0 (2024/06/03)

*   When selecting subtrees in the new builder other nodes are now deemphasized to improve visual clarity of the selection:

  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (41).png>)
* In the new builder the scene control buttons have been redesigned and relocated to the lower left of the scene:\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/image (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1) (1).png>)

<img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (40).png" alt="" data-size="original">

### UI v10.113.0 (2024/05/17)

The new recipe builder now has a new greeting card when no custom recipe is loaded. We hope this will better help newer users start on their recipe authorship journey.\

### UI v10.111.0 (2024/05/14)

#### Building recipes in Builder V2

The beta of the new builder has added controls to allow for the construction of recipes. You can now use the new builder to explore and customize the full depth of composed recipes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (30).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Adding marketplace recipes all happens now within the new Builder experience. This prevents users from having to excessively navigate when composing a custom recipe. Additionally, the new Builder supports importing recipe(s) from Yaml, running custom recipes, and exporting a custom recipe to the necessary Yaml docs. Lastly, you can now save multiple custom recipes.

This new schema and implementation **will need to be added** to your organizations service to enable this sort of hierarchy. You can find the latest schema implementation [here](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-organizations).\
\
Example hierarchy from our public tenant.

### UI v10.37.0 (2024/01/08)

We have made changes to how recently viewed activity is discovered. Previously we had 3 different pages for view previous recipes runs, commit jobs, and visualization runs:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (26).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>Previous recent pages</p></figcaption></figure>

Each of these pages would show only the individual user's activity.\
\
We are now providing a comprehensive view of these activities in one single Activity page:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/image (7) (1).png" alt=""><figcaption><p>The new activity view shows activity across an organization</p></figcaption></figure>

\
Here you can see **the most recent activities performed on the selected Organization**. This view will improve how users and teams collaborate. For more information see our [activity view docs](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/getting-started/activity-view).

**We have a new look!**

We started to encounter pain points with our previous design:

* Navigation was split across the top bar and side bar
* Long organization / repository group titles could be truncated

Unified Sidebar Navigation: All navigation elements are now consolidated into a single, intuitive side bar, simplifying the user experience and reducing the cognitive load.

Elimination of Top Bar: Removing the top navigation bar frees up valuable screen real estate, allowing for more content to be displayed and making it easier for users to focus on their work.

In Account menu > Accessibility there is now an option for Date time format that will allow you to choose between `Relative time`, `Local time`, and `UTC time`.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/date-time (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Date time stamps can also be changed by simply clicking on them to cycle through the formats:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/date-time-2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Replay YAML recipes

Custom yaml recipe runs can now be replayed. Now hitting replay on a custom recipe run summary will link to a new `/recipes/builder/[runId]` page. This page is similar to the `/recipes/builder` page however it will reflect the yaml recipe that was run making it possible to replay custom yaml recipe runs. This will also not disrupt your personal custom recipe.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/replay.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Admin agent version notice

Admin users will now see a notice that can be dismissed whenever there is a new agent version available:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/agent-update.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Additional changes

* add link to replay recipe to commit message and PR body
* display finished time for recipe runs and run history

* various visual improvements

### UI v9.83.0 (2023/04/19)

#### Replaying recipes with organizations

If a recipe was run using an _Organization_ instead of a _Repository group_, you can now quickly click to replay the recipe using either the _Organization_ that was originally used or your currently selected _Organization / Repository group._

![](../.gitbook/assets/replay-recipe.png)

These items will take you back to the recipe details page where you can copy the URL and share.

#### Filtering audit logs

Audit logs can now be filtered across multiple columns and/or values.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/multi-column.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Add confirmation before creating a new recipe builder
* Add support for quarantining and un-quarantining multiple repositories at a time

### UI v9.82.0 (2023/04/17)

We've completed a change to move over queries for _Organizations_ and _Repositories_ to use a new paginated query to improve the performance of filtering and selecting repositories. As apart of this change we've changed how _Repository groups_ are managed. Previously we had a transfer list that customers could use to handle selection. With this recent version, we've moved to a filterable data grid of repositories.

#### Recipe results

The _Data Tables_ button is now ever present on the page along side the familiar _Commit_ option. As a note the button will be disabled until a _Recipe run_ has completed.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/data-tables.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_API examples_ button has been pulled up from a collapsable portion of the summary and into a more familiar and consistant place on the page.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/api-example.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The _Replay_ _recipe_ and _Cancel run_ buttons have been consolidated into one location on the screen in part to make room for the _Api example_ button.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/replay-recipes.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Repository details

We've cleaned up the _Repository details_ screen to align with page titles on other pages as well as making the _API examples_ consistently located.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/repository-detail.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

_Language composition_ chart now contains more colors to help distinguish various languages.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/language-composition.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.73.0 (2023/03/20)

* use totalRepositoriesInProgress from graphql

### UI v9.71.0 (2023/03/15)

* We have changed the name "Catalog" to "Marketplace" and given it a new icon. We hope the use of the word "Marketplace" reflects the community aspect of "Recipe" development.\
  ![](<../.gitbook/assets/marketplace (1).png>)
* Recipes can now have `maintainers` associated with them. This has been added to the graphQL API and the UI will render them in a special contributor's section on the recipe details page if present:\
  \
  ![](../.gitbook/assets/contributors.png)

### UI v9.70.0 (2023/03/15)

* We have added operating system detection to custom tailor the user experience. The first place to use this is the CLI download dialogue which now will default the instruction set selected based on your operating system. This should reduce the confusion on what instruction to use.
* Various bug fixes and improvements

### UI v9.69.0 (2023/03/13)

### API Examples

We improved how we surface GraphQL API examples to make it easier to include multiple types of calls on a single page in one location where it's consistent to find

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/graphql-example.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.68.0 (2023/03/09)

* Try CLI `curl` example now uses URL from API Gateway

* Various bug fixes.

### UI v9.66.0 (2023/03/08)

Now you can download the Moderne CLI from your SaaS Instance.

#### Recipe builder

We've rearranged a few of the buttons to make some actions clearer to the customer. _New Recipe_ took the place of the _Import YAML_ button, which was moved to the YAML preview. _New Recipe_ will reset the state for the Recipe builder so you can start on your new endevaours.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recipe-builder.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Recipe refresh

Spring is right around the corner and we've been doing a little bit of cleaning to make the recipe page cleaner and more consistent with the rest of the site.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recipe-refresh.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Download the Moderne CLI

Go to the _Help_ menu → _Try Moderne CLI_

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/cli-download-3.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.65.0 (2023/03/03)

In our continual efforts to integrate the new organizations service we have redesigned the top navigation bar. You will now find plenty of space for displaying longer organization and repository group names as well as improvements to all drop downs menus.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/org-serv.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Notably, source management control connections have been moved into a new profile section in the avatar dropdown. Additionally, the redesigned top navigation bar is more accommodating of smaller device screens.

### UI v9.64.0 (2023/03/02)

Up until now repository groups have been stored in the users' localStorage on their browser. If users had large amounts of groups with large lists of repositories they would approach the limits of their localStorage (typically 5-10 Mb).\
\
We have now switch to using IndexedDB for this purpose which will not run into these same thresholds and provides faster reads and writes for large objects.

### UI v9.63.0 (2023/02/27)

The interactive origin icon now includes links:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/interactive-link.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We added some quality of life changes on various forms to have focus be automatically brought to the first field, for example when adding or editing a repository group.

### UI v9.62.0 (2023/02/24)

Improve support for organizations defined in thee organization service.

### UI v9.61.0 (2023/02/24)

We have added the ability to see repository origin details from the diff page via the interactive origin icon:\
![](../.gitbook/assets/icon.png)

GitHub links on recipe details for OpenRewrite recipes ([v9.35.0](changelog.md#recipe-source-links)) previously linked to a search interface to find the origin on GitHub. These have now been updated with direct links to the source.

### UI v9.60.0 (2023/02/23)

All file downloads have been standardized to use our async download manager for a more consistent experience.

### UI v9.59.0 (2023/02/23)

Add more support for organization as we shift focus on the new organization service:

* UI will now use commit options defined by the organization service
* Recipe runs in the UI and GraphQL can now use organization ID

We have also added recipe IDs to the list of recipes in the catalog to save time for those seeking them by preventing the need to drill down into each individual recipe details page.

### UI v9.58.0 (2023/02/16)

Optimize the UI's use of GraphQL queries.

### UI v9.57.0 (2023/02/15)

Added more data table driven Jupyter lite notebooks. Currently supported:

* org.openrewrite.maven.table.DependenciesInUse:
  * dependency-usage-violin.ipynb
  * dependency-usage.ipynb
* org.openrewrite.table.ParseFailures:
  * parse-failures.ipynb
* org.openrewrite.table.RecipeRunStats:
  * recipe-visit-all-performance.ipynb
  * recipe-visitor-performance.ipynb
* org.openrewrite.table.SourcesFileResults:
  * composite-recipe-results.ipynb

### UI v9.56.0 (2023/02/14)

Repository Groups has been refreshed. The global menu will now separate Organizations that are defined by either the Moderne Agent or your implementation of the Moderne Organization service and _Repository groups_ that are locally curated collections of repositories.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/repo-group.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

We've also added some visual touches to better group icons in the top navigation as well as providing you with a quick visual cue of the current selection.

### UI v9.51.0 (2023/02/01)

A new option has been added to the Pull Request form to allow or disallow the reopening of closed pull requests.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 4.46.48 PM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

`See how to run against the API` link has been added to the commit form as well. This will show the GraphQL for the action.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2023-02-01 at 4.47.03 PM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.46.0 (2023/01/21)

Data tables: Recipes can now emit tabular data according to a schema that they define.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/data-table (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/data-table-2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.44.0 (2023/01/21)

#### Repository quick view

Hover over the info icon to quickly view more information including the commit that the artifact was generated from and when it was ingested into the platform.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/repo-quick-view.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.41.0 (2023/01/17)

#### Removal of the default repository group `All`

Moderne SaaS no longer provides a default named repository group called `All` that represents all ingested repositories. Customers can [define their own named repository group](../administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/how-to-guides/agent-configuration/configure-organizations-service.md) through Agent to provide this functionality. See the example below.

```json
{
  "All": {
    "name": "All",
    "repositories": null
  },
  "Default": {
    "name": "Default",
    "repositories": [...]
  }
}
```

### UI v9.39.0 (2023/01/11)

#### Actions moved to left

Actions for grids are now presented on the left-hand side of the table.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/action-grid.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.37.0 (2023/01/10)

#### Bitbucket Cloud support

Repositories hosted on Bitbucket Cloud are now supported. This [requires additional configuration through your agent](../administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/how-to-guides/agent-configuration/configure-bitbucket-cloud-to-agent.md#prerequisites).

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/bit-cloud.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.35.0 (2022/12/30)

#### Admin token management

We have added the ability for admins to view and revoke Moderne personal access tokens of any user. There is now a new Access tokens page under the admin navigations:\
![](../.gitbook/assets/admin-token.png)\\

#### Improved keyboard shortcuts

While addressing some keyboard shortcuts that were reported to conflict with certain browsers we overhauled the keyboard shortcuts to primarily use single key commands and added more. These commands will not fire if the focus of the browser is in a text input or any control like field. Additionally, we have provided a new short cut cheat sheet that is activated with `shift`+`?`

![](../.gitbook/assets/keyboard-shortcut.png)

#### Recipe source links

We want to improve users and recipe authors' experience finding source code for a particular recipe. We have added on the recipe details pages a link on OpenRewrite recipes that will use a specialized GitHub search query to find the source. We have plans to expand this functionality in the future.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recipe-source.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.31.0 (2022/12/16)

#### Support for adding applicability tests to builder recipes

The "Add to builder" button now has an additional drop-down to support adding the current recipe to the builder as an applicability test.

These tests currently come in two variants:

* `singleSource` - The custom recipe will _**only be run on those source files**_ that would have been changed by _**all**_ `singleSource` test recipes.
* `anySource` - The custom recipe will run on _**all**_ _**source files**_ if there would have been a change from all `anySource` tests. Not all `anySource` tests have to change the _**same**_ file; as long as there would be one change from each test then the custom recipe would be run.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recipe-builder-2.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>For more information on applicability test see the <a href="https://docs.openrewrite.org/authoring-recipes/recipe-conventions-and-best-practices#use-applicability-tests">OpenRewrite documentation</a>.</p></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.29.0 (2022/12/14)

#### Show error when recipe no longer exists

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.48.21 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.28.0 (2022/12/10)

#### Origin and base branch added to commit results table

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.46.44 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.26.0 (2022/12/09)

#### Patch and commit are now disabled if there are no results to commit

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.44.05 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.25.0 (2022/12/08)

#### Add error details to errors in diffs

An Error card shows the code where the error was discovered, the error message, and now a new section called details that will show any extra details like stack traces. Additionally, the copy button in the upper right of the card now copies all sections as a string of Markdown to your copy buffer.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.41.10 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.24.0 (2022/12/02)

#### Create a new repository group from existing

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.34.45 AM.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Add see how to run GraphQL to more locations

This has been added to the following pages:

* recent commits
* commit jobs
* organizations
* workers
* quarantine

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/Screenshot 2022-12-14 at 7.38.08 AM (1).png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.23.0 (2022/11/30)

#### Ignore whitespace changes

You can now hide whitespace changes from diffs via the _Settings_ menu

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/ignore-whitespace.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.21.0 (2022/11/18)

#### Viewing result diffs

Now it's even easier to filter down the result set to only those diffs that include errors from the result diff menu bar.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/result-diff.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.15.0 (2022/11/03)

#### Status page

We have added a status page \`/status\` that displays a general summary of the site's health.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/status-page.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

#### Enhanced marker info

Recipe run results summary view now has the option to view the number of markers returned for each repository.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/enhanced-marker.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

This can also be viewed in the extended summary.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/extend-summary.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.14.0 (2022/11/02)

#### Named repository groups

Previously repository selection was performed at recipe run time. Now users will create named repository groups that will drive what repositories recipes are run against and what repositories are shown on the Organizations page. The group in use will be visible in the header. Groups can also be created from the repositories of a recipe run. There is also a `All` group by default that is all the repositories of the tenant. The named groups are initially stored in the browser's local storage.

**Running a recipe**

New groups can be created from the selected rows of a recipe run.

### UI v9.11.0 (2022/10/24)

#### Only show error hunks

In addition to using Moderne for running recipes, it is also common to use the built-in debugging tools for recipe development.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/error-chunk.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Previously, the `Only show errors` a toggle would limit diffs to only those containing errors. For large files with multiple hunks of changes, this behavior still required recipe authors to manually search for the errors that surfaced.\
\
We have changed this behavior so that `Only show errors` will now cause only the hunks with errors to render.

### UI v9.8.0

#### Commit job status

Previously the _Recent Commit Job_ page only reported the overall status of job completion. We now surface the number of successful, failed, or jobs with no changes.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/commit-status.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.7.0

#### More markers!

We have increased the types of markers we annotate and surface in the diff view of the UI. Previously the new markers will now render as squiggly lines with an icon. If there are additional details, it will allow you to click in to see those details:\
ou may have noticed search markers displaying like this:

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/marker-1.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/marker-2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In addition to search markers, we will render info/debug, warnings, and errors in a similar way:

![](../.gitbook/assets/marker-3.png)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/marker-warn (1).png>)

![](../.gitbook/assets/marker-error.png)

### UI v9.5.0

#### Improved recipe deployment

Deploying recipe artifacts now has an improved asynchronous experience. We've added the recipe artifact state and last deployment time to increase the visibility around the freshness of a recipe artifact.Notable changes to the Moderne Platform

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/recipe-deploy.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>View recipe artifact state and last deployment time.</p></figcaption></figure>

### UI v9.4.0

#### Moderne update notice

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/update-notice.png" alt=""><figcaption><p>If there is a Moderne update in the middle of your browser session, you should now see a prompt to refresh your page to ensure you have the latest version available.</p></figcaption></figure>
