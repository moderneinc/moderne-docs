# Moderne Docs

The docs behind [https://docs.moderne.io/](https://docs.moderne.io/). For OpenRewrite docs, please see the [rewrite-docs repository](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-docs).

## Contributing

We encourage you to contribute to our docs! Please feel free to create an issue or open a PR if you find any issues.

We use [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) to manage our documentation. When any changes are merged into this repository, a build is kicked off to update the docs.

## Standards

* In document titles and headers, use sentence case. That is, capitalize only the first word in the title, the first word in a subheading after a colon, and any proper nouns or other terms that are always capitalized a certain way. Don't put a period at the end of a title or heading.
* When using acronyms, you must always fully define the acronym before it can be used in the document. For instance, you would say something like: "The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) did..." Then, in the rest of the document, you can freely use NATO instead.
