# Welcome to Moderne

With [Moderne](https://moderne.io), you can fix security vulnerabilities, standardize code quality, and automate maintenance processes such as framework migrations. Code refactoring work and security vulnerability remediations that used to take months and teams of developers can be done in minutes. This can not only save your company millions of dollars in software maintenance costs, but it can also give developers substantially more time to focus on delivering business value.

## The Moderne platform

The Moderne platform is an enterprise-ready, private Software as a Service (SaaS) solution that provides automated code remediation at scale. The platform asynchronously ingests detailed artifacts of your codebase ([Lossless Semantic Trees](administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/references/concepts/lossless-semantic-trees.md)) that can be quickly and precisely searched. Then, your organization's source code can be transformed by running "[recipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes)" across repositories of your choosing. These recipes can be created by your team, or you can take advantage of the hundreds of recipes already defined in [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) – an open-source project managed by Moderne.

The platform offers a clean UI that enables anyone in your organization to run recipes, create PRs, or generate detailed reports about your codebase – all without writing a line of code. It also provides a recommendation engine to help you discover new recipes based on an analysis of your code.

Moderne is SOC 2 Type 2 compliant, so you can be confident that your code is secure. Furthermore, a private SaaS can be created for your team in any major cloud provider or region of your choice.

Moderne currently supports [numerous languages, data formats, build tools, and frameworks](broken-reference) with [even more coming soon](broken-reference). Moderne also currently supports [most Git-based source code management tools](administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/references/supported-scms.md).

## Want to try it for yourself?

Moderne offers a free [public instance](https://app.moderne.io/) where you can run hundreds of recipes across thousands of open-source repositories.

Or if you want to test this out in a custom private instance made just for your team, please fill out [this form](https://lq7oxv9ggnm.typeform.com/ContactUs?typeform-source=https://docs.moderne.io/) and we will get back to you to set up a proof of value meeting.
