# How to create visualizations

Visualizations provide a unique way of looking at the data generated by specific recipes. A visualization could be a complex image that you can zoom in and out of to examine connections between nodes or it could be as simple as a text-based table that you can filter or search.

In this short guide, we will walk you through how to create your own visualizations.

## Instructions

A visualization is composed of four things:

1. A [Jupyter/IPython Notebook](https://ipython.org/notebook.html) (e.g., [depenedency vulnerability notebook](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne_visualizations_misc/dependency_vulnerabilities.ipynb)).
2. A ["spec"](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne_visualizations_misc/specs/dependency_vulnerabilities.yml) which defines the visualization and states which recipes the visualization applies to.
3. (_Optional, but recommended_) [An image](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne_visualizations_misc/images/dependency_vulnerabilities.300.png) that represents the visualization. If your recipe spec was named `foo_bar` and your image had a height of 300 pixels, your image should be named `foo_bar.300.png`.
4. (_Optional, but recommended_) [Sample data](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/samples/dependency_vulnerabilities.csv) for testing the visualization.

You should create these pieces inside of a repository that you will then publish as a PyPI package to an internal PyPI repository.

Once you've done that, please [configure your agent with access to said repository](../how-to-guides/agent-configuration/configure-an-agent-with-pypi-access-visualizations.md).

For examples of visualizations the Moderne team has created, please check out our public [moderne-visualizations-misc repository](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc).
