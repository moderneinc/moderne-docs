# Troubleshooting LST issues

This guide will help you diagnose and resolve common issues with Lossless Semantic Trees (LSTs) in the Moderne platform.

## LST built but not showing up in an organization

### Common root causes

When an LST is missing from your organization, the issue is typically caused by:

* **Origin mismatch**: The repository's `origin` doesn't match your version control system (VCS) configuration.
* **Path/branch mismatch**: The repository's `path` or `branch` doesn't match what's defined in your organization hierarchy.

### Troubleshooting steps

#### Step 1: Determine your organization setup

Does your company provide an [organizational hierarchy to Moderne](./agent-configuration/configure-organizations-hierarchy.md)? If so, jump to [Step 2b](#step-2b-organizational-hierarchy-provided). If not, proceed to [Step 2a](#step-2a-no-organizational-hierarchy-provided).

#### Step 2a: No organizational hierarchy provided

If your company **does not** provide an organizational hierarchy to Moderne, then your issue is an `origin` mismatch.

#### To diagnose:

1. Navigate to the repositories list located at `https://TENANT.moderne.io/organizations` (replace `TENANT` in the URL with your company's Moderne tenant)
2. Search for the repository whose LST is missing
3. You should see a warning icon in the `origin` column. If you mouse over it, you will see a warning about a "Missing SCM info for &lt;some VCS&gt;". Remember that VCS for the next step.

</figure>

#### To fix:

Check your VCS URL in your Agent configuration. For example, if this is a GitHub repo, check that `MODERNE_AGENT_GITHUB_0_URL` is `https://github.com` (or the base URL of your on-prem GitHub instance).

If your VCS is Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center, and you use a non-standard SSH port or a different URL, make sure that you have an alternate URL defined via `MODERNE_AGENT_BITBUCKET_0_ALTERNATEURLS_0`.

#### Step 2b: Organizational hierarchy provided

If your company **does** provide an organizational hierarchy, the issue could be either an `origin` mismatch or a `path`/`branch` mismatch.

#### To diagnose:

Use the [Lost and Found GraphQL query](#using-the-lost-and-found-query) to check if your repository is listed.

* **If found**: Your repository exists but has issues that prevent it from being usable. This could be due to:
  - Missing from organizational hierarchy (doesn't match the `origin`, `path`, or `branch` defined in your organizational hierarchy)
  - SCM configuration mismatch (orphaned repository with no connected agent)
  - [See the fix below](#to-fix-1).
* **If not found**: Proceed to [check for an `origin` mismatch](#check-for-an-origin-mismatch) (the next section). 

#### To fix: 

Update your `repos.csv` file to ensure the `origin`, `path`, and `branch` values match your repository _exactly_. 

#### Check for an `origin` mismatch

#### To diagnose:

1. Navigate to `https://TENANT.moderne.io/organizations` (replace `TENANT` in the URL with your company's Moderne tenant)
2. Click `Organization` in the left nav and select the organization you expect this repository to appear in:

</figure>

3. Search for the repository in question
4. You should see a warning icon in the `origin` column. If you mouse over it, you will see a warning about a "Missing SCM info for &lt;some VCS&gt;". Remember that VCS for the next step.

#### To fix:

Check your VCS URL in your Agent configuration. For example, if this is a GitHub repo, check that `MODERNE_AGENT_GITHUB_0_URL` is `https://github.com` (or the base URL of your on-prem GitHub instance).

If your VCS is Bitbucket Server or Bitbucket Data Center, and you use a non-standard SSH port or a different URL, make sure that you have an alternate URL defined via `MODERNE_AGENT_BITBUCKET_0_ALTERNATEURLS_0`.

## Using the Lost and Found query

The Lost and Found feature provides a comprehensive view of all repositories that are not usable in the Moderne platform for various reasons. Use this query when troubleshooting repository visibility issues.

### Running the query

1. Navigate to the GraphQL API explorer at `https://TENANT.moderne.io/graphql` (replace `TENANT` with your company's Moderne tenant)
2. Run this query to see all repositories with issues:

```graphql
query lostAndFoundRepositories {
  lostAndFound {
    repositories {
      count
      pageInfo {
        hasNextPage
        startCursor
        endCursor
      }
      edges {
        node {
          origin
          path
          branch
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

:::info
**What the Lost and Found query returns:**

1. **Organizationless repositories** - Repositories not part of any organization due to:
   - Missing from your `repos.csv` file
   - Mismatched `origin`, `path`, or `branch` values in your organizational hierarchy

2. **Orphaned repositories** - Repositories from SCM tools with no connected agent due to:
   - Agent was previously connected but is now disconnected
   - SCM configuration doesn't match any connected agent
   - URL mismatches between repository origin and agent configuration

Returns up to 100 results at a time by default.
:::

### Advanced usage

**Pagination:**
```graphql
query paginatedResults {
  lostAndFound {
    repositories(first: 100, after: "CURSOR_HERE") {
      edges { node { origin path branch } }
      pageInfo { endCursor hasNextPage }
    }
  }
}
```

**Filtering and sorting:**
```graphql
query sortedResults {
  lostAndFound {
    repositories(filter: { sortBy: PATH, sortOrder: ASC }) {
      edges { node { origin path branch } }
    }
  }
}
```

Sort options: `PATH`, `ORIGIN`, `BRANCH` | Sort orders: `ASC`, `DESC`
