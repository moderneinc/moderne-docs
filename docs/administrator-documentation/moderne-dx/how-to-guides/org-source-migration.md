# Organization source migration

In order to simplify Moderne's operational complexity, we decided that configuring organizational hierarchies should only require creating a file and giving it to Moderne DX (either via direct access or via an unauthenticated HTTP/S endpoint), rather than running a dedicated endpoint for organizational hierarchy via an Organizations service.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know to migrate this functionality to Moderne DX.

## Migration instructions

At a high-level, the migration process is as follows:

1. Create the new files.
2. Configure DX to use them.
3. (Optionally) If you don't plan on using an Organizations service anymore, remove it from your system.

### 1. Create the new files and put them somewhere DX can access

1. Copy the `devcenter.json` file from your Organization service and put it somewhere where DX can access. This could mean putting this file on the same file system that DX has access to â€“ or it could mean putting it behind an unauthenticated HTTP/S endpoint.
2. Follow [our guide for creating a repos.csv file](../../references/repos-csv.md). Alternatively, if your Organization service already uses a `repos.csv`, you may copy that file directly and put it somewhere where DX can access (either by putting it on a file system DX has access to or by putting the file behind an unauthenticated HTTP/S endpoint that DX can call).

### 2. Configure DX to use the new variables 

Update the relevant variables in your DX deployment so that DX knows where these files are.
