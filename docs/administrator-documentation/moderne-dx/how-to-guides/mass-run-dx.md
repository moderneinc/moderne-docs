# Mass run

Mass run is a central worker (or set of workers) that uses the Moderne CLI to run recipes across all of your repositories at scale.

With mass run, central teams and business unit leaders can do things like:

* Run search recipes to extract org-wide insights
* Push critical security fixes out to teams across the organization
* Generate reports and DevCenter dashboards

## Prerequisites

Before setting up mass run, you'll need to have [mass ingest](./mass-ingest-dx.md) configured and running.

## Getting started

For detailed instructions on how to set up mass run, please follow the directions in the [Moderne mass run example repository](https://github.com/moderneinc/mass-run-example?tab=readme-ov-file#mass-run).
