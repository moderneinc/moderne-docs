# Introduction workshop overview

[OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) is a framework for writing and running code transformations. [Recipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes) are the unit of work in OpenRewrite, and can be written in [YAML](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes#declarative-recipes), [Refaster](https://docs.openrewrite.org/authoring-recipes/refaster-recipes), or [imperative Java](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes#imperative-recipes).

In this workshop, we'll walk through everything you need to know to get started with recipe development â€“ from writing simple YAML recipes, to creating complex imperative recipes, along with all of the steps in between such as testing or debugging recipes.

This workshop is designed to be hands-on, so you can follow along with the examples in your own environment. The workshop consists of the materials you see here, and a set of exercises to help you practice what you've learned.

Be sure to also follow links to the [OpenRewrite documentation](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) for more in-depth information. Feel free to skip around to the sections that interest you most, based on your needs and experience level.

If you get stuck, or have questions, feel free to ask in the [OpenRewrite Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-nj42n3ea-b\~62rIHzb3Vo0E1APKCXEA) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xk3ZKrhWAb).
