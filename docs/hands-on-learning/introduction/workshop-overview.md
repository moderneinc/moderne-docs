# Overview: Introduction to OpenRewrite

[OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) is a framework for writing and running code transformations and [recipes](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/recipes) are the unit of work in OpenRewrite. This workshop is designed to help you understand how [OpenRewrite](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) works and gain hands-on experience running recipes using the Moderne CLI and the Moderne Platform.

You will learn about fundamental concepts like the [Lossless Semantic Tree (LST)](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/lossless-semantic-trees), as well as key platform features including [data tables](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-platform/getting-started/data-tables/), [visualizations](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-platform/getting-started/visualizations), and [DevCenters](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-platform/getting-started/dev-center).

Be sure to also follow the links to the [OpenRewrite documentation](https://docs.openrewrite.org/) for more in-depth information. Feel free to skip around to the sections that interest you most, based on your needs and experience level.

If you get stuck or have questions, feel free to ask in the [OpenRewrite Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-nj42n3ea-b~62rIHzb3Vo0E1APKCXEA) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xk3ZKrhWAb).

## What you'll learn

* Key concepts of OpenRewrite: LSTs, visitors, and recipes
* How to set up and run recipes using the Moderne CLI
* How to use the Moderne recipe builder to compose and customize declarative YAML recipes
* What search markers, data tables, and visualizations and how to use them
* How to use DevCenter to track migrations and upgrades

## Prerequisites

To get the most out of this workshop, you should have:

* Basic Java knowledge
* A basic understanding of how to work with the command line/terminal

You will also need the following installed on your system:

* JDK (Java 17 or higher recommended)

## Workshop modules

* [Module 1: CLI setup and running recipes](./module-1-running-recipes.md) - Download, install, and configure the Moderne CLI, then run recipes across repositories
* [Module 2: Recipe builder and declarative recipes](./module-2-recipe-builder.md) - Learn to compose YAML recipes using the Moderne recipe builder
* [Module 3: Search markers, data tables, and visualizations](./module-3-data-tables-visualizations.md) - Understand how recipes can produce insights beyond code changes
* [Module 4: DevCenter](./module-4-devcenter.md) - Track migrations and upgrades at scale with DevCenter
