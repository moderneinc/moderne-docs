# CLI releases

The Moderne CLI is actively developed and frequently updated. We differentiate between stable releases and staging releases. Stable releases are recommended for production use, while staging releases may include new features and bug fixes that are still being tested.

Typical use case for staging releases is to try out new features and provide feedback before they are included in a stable release. Moderne users can possibly encounter bugs or issues when using staging releases, so they should be used with caution. One of the primary goals of the stable release is the use of it for mass ingest of repositories into Moderne where high reliability is required.

| --------------------- | --------------- |
| CLI version (Stable)  | 3.43.6          |
| CLI version (Staging) | 3.46.2          |
