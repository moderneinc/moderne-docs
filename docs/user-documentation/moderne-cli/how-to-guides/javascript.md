# How to set up and use JavaScript LSTs with the Moderne CLI

Moderne recently announced support for JavaScript and TypeScript LSTs. With this, JavaScript refactoring changes from being _syntax-bound_ to _semantically-aware_ – where recipes can distinguish between lookalike methods, resolve types, and understand dependency graphs.

In this guide, we'll walk you through how to configure the Moderne CLI to take advantage of this new JavaScript functionality.

## Prerequisites

This guide assumes that:

* You have [installed and configured the Moderne CLI](../getting-started/cli-intro.md) (version `3.49.0` or higher)
* You are familiar with running Moderne CLI commands (if not, work through our [CLI workshop](../getting-started/moderne-cli-workshop.md))

## Step 1: Update your `moderne.yml` file

In order to enable JavaScript support, you will need to update the [build steps](./build-steps.md) in your `moderne.yml` file to include JavaScript. This file is located at `~/.moderne/cli/moderne.yml` and is created when you first set up the CLI.

If your `moderne.yml` file already includes a `build` section, you can just add the `-type: javascript` line to the end of your build steps. If it doesn't, you will need to add the entire section as seen in the example below:

```yml title="moderne.yml"
# Other keys and values...
license:
  key: some-license
tenant:
  host: https://app.moderne.io
  apiHost: https://api.app.moderne.io
  skipSsl: false
  authorization: Bearer mat-some-token
// highlight-start
build:
  steps:
    - type: maven
    - type: gradle
    - type: bazel
    - type: javascript
// highlight-end
```

## Step 2: Build your JavaScript repositories

The next thing you'll need to do is build each of the repositories by running `mod build`. If JavaScript has been set up correctly, you should see output similar to:

```bash
▶ axios/axios@v1.x
    Build output will be written to build.log
    # highlight-start
    > Step 1 - build with JavaScript
        Selected Node 22.9.0
        Starting parsing of 169 files
    ✓ Built axios-20251010075558262-ast.jar
    # highlight-end
    Cleaned 1 older builds
```

## Step 3: Run recipes

With the LST built, you can now run recipes against your JavaScript repositories. While the JavaScript recipe library is being built out, keep in mind that some Java recipes can be used to run against your JavaScript code.

Below are some examples of Java recipes that work well with JavaScript repositories:

```bash
# Find all method calls to React hooks
mod run . --recipe org.openrewrite.java.search.FindMethods -PmethodPattern="React use*(..)"

# Find all React.CSSProperties components
mod run . --recipe org.openrewrite.java.search.FindTypes -PfullyQualifiedTypeName="React.CSSProperties"

# Change a method name to something else
mod run . --recipe org.openrewrite.java.ChangeMethodName -PmethodPattern="* test(..)" -PnewMethodName="customTest"
```

## Step 4: View data tables

Many recipes will also produce useful data tables that you can access via the `mod study` command such as in:

```bash
# highlight-start
➜ mod study . --last-recipe-run --data-table MethodCalls
# highlight-end
