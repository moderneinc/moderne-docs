<ReactPlayer className="reactPlayer" url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bt-zCrAWRAc' controls="true" />

#### Summary and related links

* **Announcements for the week**
  * [We are continuing to offer OpenRewrite training sessions to help people learn about using OpenRewrite effectively](https://www.moderne.ai/moderne-openrewrite-training-hub)
  * [We have a new webinar coming up about doing code maintenance with AI](https://www.moderne.ai/content-library/code-maintenance-at-scale-with-ai)
  * [We've released a new migrate to Java 25 recipe to help y'all get caught up with the latest Java versions](https://docs.openrewrite.org/recipes/java/migrate/upgradetojava25)
* **Summary**
  * [Traits](https://docs.openrewrite.org/concepts-and-explanations/traits) are a way to build higher-level abstractions over LST elements. They allow you to define common characteristics or behaviors that might apply to different types of LST elements or involve more context than a single element can provide.
  * They help consolidate shared logic that you might otherwise put in utility classes, avoiding the need to add extension methods to every LST element. This keeps the public-facing API simpler while maintaining extensibility.
  * Some examples of traits include the annotation trait (which represents any LST element that has an annotation, regardless of whether it's a class, method, or variable declaration) and the Gradle dependency trait (which represents different ways dependencies can be declared in Gradle files and provides a common interface to access details like group ID, artifact ID, and version).
  * Traits can be converted into a **visitor** (using `asVisitor())` which allows you to process only the LST elements that implement that specific trait, effectively filtering down to what you're interested in as a recipe author.
  * We also demonstrated how to create a `TodoComment` trait with a `Matcher` to identify these comments across different file types.

### OpenRewrite power moves part 2: Scanning recipes (September 10th, 2025)

<ReactPlayer className="reactPlayer" url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p62K0iRIzvA' controls="true" />

#### Summary and related links

### OpenRewrite power moves part 1: Using data tables (September 3rd, 2025)

<ReactPlayer className="reactPlayer" url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SuG97eQHYzQ' controls="true" />

#### Summary and related links

* **Announcements for the week**
  * [Olga wrote an article about why AI alone fails at large-scale code modernization](https://thenewstack.io/why-ai-alone-fails-at-large-scale-code-modernization/)
  * [We are continuing to offer OpenRewrite training sessions to help people learn about using OpenRewrite effectively](https://www.moderne.ai/moderne-openrewrite-training-hub)
  * The 2nd annual Code Remix Summit is happening May 11th-13th, 2026 in Florida. Please [submit your session proposals](https://sessionize.com/code-remix-summit-2026) by October 31st, 2025.
* **Summary**
  * This week we talked about how to create and use data tables with OpenRewrite recipes. We walked through extending the `DataTable` class and gave examples of various ways you can interact with it. We also talked through how you can test data tables in unit tests.
  * A couple of important notes about data tables that were mentioned:
    * You _do not_ need to create a scanning recipe to use a data table
    * Data tables can be used to generate reports (e.g., class hierarchy or to-do lists). They also can be used to generate visualizations.

### Live Spring AI coding and real-world use cases (August 27th, 2025)

<ReactPlayer className="reactPlayer" url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FiMpvYntyxA' controls="true" />

#### Summary and related links

* **Announcements for the week**
  * [We'll be at Gartner APPS in London on September 8th-9th](https://www.gartner.com/en/conferences/emea/applications-uk)
  * [We'll be at SwampUp in Napa, California on September 8th-10th](https://swampup.jfrog.com/#sponsors)
  * [We are continuing to offer OpenRewrite training sessions to help people learn about using OpenRewrite effectively](https://www.moderne.ai/moderne-openrewrite-training-hub)
* **Summary**
  * This week we welcomed Mark Heckler. He spoke about Spring AI and how it provides a unified interface to interact with various AI models (similar to how Spring Data works with different backend stores). He then demonstrated practical use cases for Spring AI. These include:
    * **Text generation** – Generating a summary or even a haiku based on a provided topic using an AI template.
    * **Retrieval augmented generation (RAG)** – Enhancing AI responses by integrating internal documents with a vector store. This allows for specific, fact-based answers relevant to the user's data.
    * **Conversational AI** – Maintaining separate conversation contexts using a conversation AI to prevent data cross-pollination between different user interactions
    * **MCP / Tool calling** – Integrating AI with deterministic external tools, like a weather service, to provide real-time, context-aware information.
    * **Multimodal AI** – Explaining an image and extracting information from it. Often combined with RAG to provide contextually relevant results.
  * While AI offers immense potential, it's crucial to understand that AI has weaknesses – especially regarding determinism vs. non-determinism. Mark advocated for combining AI's capabilities with deterministic options for best results.

    * [Don't forget we are going to be hosting a Code Remix summit in May. If you want to come and you need a discount, please send us a message](https://coderemix.ai/speakers).
  * **Releases**
    * [There's a new .patch release of OpenRewrite and plugins](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/releases/tag/v8.48.1). There were 37 commits in this week's release!
  * **Java 24**
    * We are aware that Java 24 has been released and that [there is some incompatibility with that](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues/4768). We are eyeing an early `rewrite-java-25` module instead.
* **Main topic for the week**
  * This week we welcome back Shannon Pamperl. He's one of the oldest and most prolific contributors to OpenRewrite. If you've kept up with code remix weekly sessions, you may recall Shannon as he's been on multiple times before sharing some of the cool things he's done.
  * His latest heroic deeds have been around [Gradle Kotlin support](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/issues/3291) – which has been an open issue for a few years now.
    * [PR for Gradle Kotlin DSL](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/pull/5122)
    * [PR for Gradle Kotlin DSL recipes](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/pull/5158)
  * The big focus has been around adding/upgrading/changing dependencies as those are central to general migrations.
  * After this initial explanation, Sam asked, "Is there a path forward for type-attributed Gradle Kotlin scripts?"
    * The answer is "it's probably possible" - either Gradle has to start providing a library that's more easily consumable or we have to require a Gradle distribution being available anytime we need to do parsing. This would be fine for the CLI - but much harder for the Moderne Platform.
    * There was also some follow-up discussion on the feasibility of type tables.
  * Next up we talked about future goals and what Shannon's plans are going forward. Things like what recipes still need to be done and when is the Gradle Kotlin chapter "complete" or not.
  * This transitioned into a discussion of what other areas of OpenRewrite interest Shannon.

### Meet Moddy: AI Agent for Multi-Repo Modernization (March 12th, 2025)

<ReactPlayer className="reactPlayer" url='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JlfCzgZxObA' controls="true" />

#### Summary and related links

* **Announcements for the week**
  * **Releases**
    * We've done a [new release of OpenRewrite](https://bsky.app/profile/openrewrite.github.io/post/3lk72jeovqs2p)! New features include a Gradle KTS parser, the promotion of rewrite-kotlin, and the ability to parse `.mvn`/`.mvnconfig` properties.
  * **Events**
    * Today, in Germany, [Merlin will be presenting at 30 Jahre Java](https://entwickler.de/live-events/30-jahre-java/).
    * [Tim will be presenting at MiniConfg on March 20th in the Netherlands](https://programme.miniconf.io/sessions/episode-x/2025-01-05/). In that conference, you can come ask Tim anything about OpenRewrite.
    * A few weeks later, on April 1st - 3rd, [Tim will be presenting at JavaLand on Generative AI on millions of lines of code](https://programme.miniconf.io/sessions/episode-x/2025-01-05/).
    * [Don't forget we are going to be hosting a Code Remix summit in May. If you want to come and you need a discount, please send us a message](https://coderemix.ai/speakers).
* **Interesting community question**
  * There was a community question that we thought was particularly notable and wanted to call out. Someone asked, "Is there a way to tell `rewriteTest` to ignore formatting when comparing before and after? Likewise, can we just compare LST equivalence while ignoring static imports or fully qualified types?"
    * You can find the detailed answer for that in our [OpenRewrite FAQ page](https://docs.openrewrite.org/reference/faq#is-there-a-way-to-tell-rewritetest-to-ignore-formatting-when-comparing-before-and-after-likewise-can-we-just-compare-lst-equivalence-while-ignoring-static-imports-or-fully-qualified-types).
* **Main topic for the week**
  * This week we welcomed back Justine – who talked about our new AI agent: Moddy. For a detailed written guide on this, check out [our blog post where we introduced Moddy](https://www.moderne.ai/blog/introducing-moderne-multi-repo-ai-agent-for-transforming-code-at-scale).
  * If you've kept up with our code remix sessions, you may remember that [Justine was on a code remix session a few weeks ago](#modernes-next-chapter-in-ai-innovation-january-8th-2025) talking about something similar – Mod Agent. That was the precursor to the latest version – Moddy.
  * One of the first key points we discussed was about what Moddy is and what it isn't. Moddy **is not** a fully trained LLM model like ChatGPT or Llama or whatnot. Rather, it's meant to **augment** those existing models and connect them to Moderne and OpenRewrite – which is the irreplaceable core. In fact, users can choose to use whatever model they want with Moddy.
  * By creating Moddy like this, it means that people can safely run Moddy on their own internal code base without us ever seeing or having access to their code.
  * We also touched upon the interesting question of, "Why do you need to augment a model like this? Can't you just ask one of those other models to rewrite a 100,000 files for me?"
    * There are a couple reasons for this – first of all, it takes a significant amount of time to run these models. If you're passing in millions of lines of code and thousands of repos, you're going to be waiting a ridiculous amount of time. Then, even when (if) it does finish, it will likely be filled with hallucinations that lead to broken code. Lastly, for many of these models, you would be required to give these LLMs access to your code – which doesn't make sense for most companies.
  * After that, Justine took us through a demo of Moddy. With it, you can discover/find relevant recipes and, also, ask it intelligent questions about your code such as, "What repositories do I use Apache Commons in?"
  * Moddy isn't widely available yet -- but it will be soon for Moderne customers so keep your eyes out for it.

  * **Releases**:
    * Lombok support has been officially released. Make sure you're using version [v8.45.5 or higher](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite/releases/tag/v8.45.5).
* **Main topic for the week - type tables**
  * Historically, many of our recipes that updated insecure libraries to secure ones caused some problems for people that had vulnerability scanners. That's because, as part of fixing the old code, we needed to have the old JARs to compile that old code. The JARs were **never** executed, but it still caused people to be concerned. To remedy this, we've created type tables.
  * Now, instead of pulling in the whole JAR, we throw away the implementation and take _just_ enough for type attribution. These type types are not a class and can't be re-hydrated into anything executable. This lets us run recipes against old, insecure code without having to take in a concerning JAR.
  * Type tables have an additional benefit beyond not getting security warnings – size savings. Using type tables, we are able to reduce the size of the libraries we need to pull in by 90%. Because of that, every release of OpenRewrite will now being significantly smaller.
  * Below are relevant links that you might find useful about this topic:

  * Right now, the bot is very focused on search recipes and displaying results. It can be really helpful when you want to run multiple search recipes without even knowing what those recipes are.
  * This will hopefully be available soon<sup>*</sup>
