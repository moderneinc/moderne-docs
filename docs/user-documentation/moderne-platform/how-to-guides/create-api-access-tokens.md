# Creating a personal access token

In order to use the [Moderne GraphQL API](https://api.app.moderne.io/), you will need to create a Personal Access Token. These tokens have the same level of permissions as your account â€“ meaning that if you are an admin, your tokens will have admin permissions.

:::info
If you want to learn how to use an access token, please go to the [Accessing the Moderne API doc](./accessing-the-moderne-api.md).

If you want to use this token with the Moderne CLI, please see the [CLI getting started guide](../../moderne-cli/getting-started/cli-intro.md#step-3-connect-the-cli-to-moderne) for instructions on how to do that.

4. In the text box that says `Enter token name`, enter a descriptive name for your token so that it can easily be distinguished from other tokens.

5. Set when the token should expire by clicking on the date selector next to the token name:

6. Copy your token to a safe place such as a password manager. You won't be able to see the token again if you close the window.

## How to view your access tokens

From the [access token](https://app.moderne.io/settings/access-token) page (where you previously created the token), you can see a list of all the tokens:
