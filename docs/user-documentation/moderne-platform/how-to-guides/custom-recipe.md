Many people have custom ESLint plugins or other CLI tools that they want to use inside of a recipe so that they can apply it to a large number of repositories.

This guide will walk you through everything you need to know in order to do that.

## Step 1: Create a recipe repository

The first thing you'll need to do is to create a repository for where your recipe should live.

If you are wanting to use a custom ESLint plugin or tool that is available on NPM inside of your recipe, then you should strongly consider forking our [rewrite-codemods repository](https://github.com/moderneinc/rewrite-codemods) as it already includes a lot of the pieces you'll need.

If you are wanting to use some other tool or dependency, consider starting with our [rewrite-recipe-starter repository](https://github.com/moderneinc/rewrite-recipe-starter).

## Step 2: Add your dependencies

If your dependency is available on NPM, please update the `package.json` file inside of your repository and add your dependency:

```json title="Package.json"
{
  "dependencies": {
    "eslint": "^8.56.0",
    "eslint-config-prettier": "^9.1.0",
  }
}
```

You'll then need to ensure that wherever you are building the recipe JAR is able to resolve this dependency from the registry of your choosing (this could be a public NPM registry like `npmjs` or `unpkg` or a private one â€“ like one setup in Artifactory).

## Step 3: Create the recipe

If you are using a custom ESLint plugin, you should create a YAML recipe similar to the [ones in our codemods repository](https://github.com/moderneinc/rewrite-codemods/tree/main/src/main/resources/META-INF/rewrite).

If you are wanting to use a custom CLI tool, you will need to create a new recipe that extends `NodeBaseRecipe`. Check out our [ESLint recipe](https://github.com/moderneinc/rewrite-codemods/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/codemods/ESLint.java) for a full example of this.

You may find it useful to add code so that your recipe produces a [data table](https://docs.moderne.io/user-documentation/moderne-platform/getting-started/data-tables/). Data tables are tabular data that people can use for analysis purposes. They also can be useful for creating visualizations of the results.

A good example of a recipe that uses a custom tool and produces a data table is the [UI5 recipe](https://github.com/moderneinc/rewrite-codemods/blob/main/src/main/java/org/openrewrite/codemods/UI5.java#L153-L162). They then use this data table to produce a visualization ([yaml](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne_visualizations_misc/specs/ui5lint_violations_heatmap.yml) [ipynb](https://github.com/moderneinc/moderne-visualizations-misc/blob/main/moderne_visualizations_misc/ui5lint_violations_heatmap.ipynb)).

## Step 4: Deploy your recipe

With your recipe created, you'll need to deploy it as usual. If you use the Moderne Platform, check out [our guide on how to import external recipes](https://docs.moderne.io/administrator-documentation/moderne-platform/how-to-guides/importing-external-recipes). If you are a Moderne DX user, check out [our guide on how to deploy recipe artifacts with Moderne DX](https://docs.moderne.io/administrator-documentation/moderne-dx/how-to-guides/deploying-recipe-artifacts-in-moderne-dx/).
