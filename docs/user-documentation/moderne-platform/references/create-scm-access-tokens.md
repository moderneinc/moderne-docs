# Creating SCM access tokens

In order to perform [commits](../how-to-guides/recipe-execution-and-commits-with-graphql.md#creating-a-pull-request) using the [Moderne GraphQL API](https://api.app.moderne.io/), you will need to create an SCM Access Token.

Commit tasks like `pullRequest` now support optionally defining a Personal Access Token that you create through your SCM and provide as a GraphQL Mutation input.

You must grant sufficient permission when creating these Personal Access Tokens. These permissions will vary from provider to provider but generally include read/write access to Repositories and Pull Requests.

**Note:** _Bitbucket Data Center and Server requires version 5.5.x or later_
