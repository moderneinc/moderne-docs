# Common recipe customizations

Many organizations use custom parent projects that extend Spring Boot with organization-specific standards â€“ such as fixed dependency versions, additional Maven plugins, or company-wide configuration details. When upgrading these environments, we recommend creating custom declarative recipes that build on standard upgrade recipes, while also incorporating your specific customizations. This approach provides full control over how upgrades are deployed across your organization's project.

To help you get started with that, this doc will provide some common customization patterns we've often seen Moderne customers use.

## Proprietary Spring Boot upgrade

Let's suppose you have a parent project called `moderne-parent` that:

* Manages your Spring Boot version
* Configures shared dependencies and plugins
* Services as the parent for most of your projects.

In this instance, you typically need to **upgrade the parent project first** before rolling out the Spring Boot upgrade to dependent projects.

The following declarative recipe accomplishes this: 

```yaml
type: specs.openrewrite.org/v1beta/recipe
name: io.moderne.ModerneSpringBootUpgrade
displayName: ModerneSpringBootUpgrade
description: >
  Spring Boot upgrade recipe that takes into account the need to update the
  io.moderne:moderne-parent first.
recipeList:
  # Update the <parent> version
  - org.openrewrite.maven.UpgradeParentVersion:
      groupId: io.moderne
      artifactId: moderne-parent
      newVersion: 1.2.x
  # Change the Spring configuration property from `io.moderne.this` to `io.moderne.that`
  - org.openrewrite.java.spring.ChangeSpringPropertyValue:
      propertyKey: io.moderne.this
      newValue: io.moderne.that
  # Renames an environment variable used in Kubernetes YAML files from `IO_MODERNE_THIS` to `IO_MODERNE_THAT`
  - org.openrewrite.yaml.ChangeValue:
      keyPath: $.spec.template.spec.containers[*].env[?(@.name == 'IO_MODERNE_THIS')].name
      value: IO_MODERNE_THAT
  # Apply the default Spring Boot 3.5 upgrade recipe
  - io.moderne.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_5
```

#### Implementation steps

Once you've created this recipe, you will need to:

1. Run the `io.moderne.java.spring.boot3.UpgradeSpringBoot_3_5` against the parent project to ensure it's updated and properly configured.
2. Run the custom recipe `io.moderne.ModerneSpringBootUpgrade` against any projects that use `io.moderne:moderne-parent` as a parent.

This sequence ensures dependencies are upgraded in the correct order and prevents version conflicts during the upgrade process.
