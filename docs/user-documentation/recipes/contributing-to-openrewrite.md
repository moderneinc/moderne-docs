# Contributing to OpenRewrite

If you've written your own recipes, you might want to contribute back to the OpenRewrite community. For any new contribution, the first thing to check is whether there is already a corresponding [issue on the backlog](https://github.com/orgs/openrewrite/projects/4/views/10), perhaps with some pointers on an implementation. If not, you can [create a new issue](https://github.com/openrewrite/rewrite-spring/issues/new/choose) to discuss the recipe you'd like to develop.

We have some [good first issues](https://github.com/orgs/openrewrite/projects/4/views/10?filterQuery=-label%3A%22parser\*%22+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) in particular that are great when you're just starting out and want feedback on your work to help improve your skills.

Note that there are separate modules for Spring recipes, Java recipes, testing recipes, logging recipes, and many more. It helps to browse the existing modules for any related work that might be similar and start from there.

For any further questions, feel free to ask in the [OpenRewrite Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/rewriteoss/shared_invite/zt-nj42n3ea-b\~62rIHzb3Vo0E1APKCXEA) or [Discord](https://discord.gg/xk3ZKrhWAb). Hope to see you there!
