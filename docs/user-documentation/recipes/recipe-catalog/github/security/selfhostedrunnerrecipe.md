# Find usage of self-hosted runners

**org.openrewrite.github.security.SelfHostedRunnerRecipe**

_Find workflows that use `self-hosted` runners, which may have security implications in public repositories due to potential persistence between workflow runs and lack of isolation. Self-hosted runners should be properly secured and ideally ephemeral. Based on [zizmor's `self-hosted-runner` audit](https://github.com/woodruffw/zizmor/blob/main/crates/zizmor/src/audit/self_hosted_runner.rs)._
