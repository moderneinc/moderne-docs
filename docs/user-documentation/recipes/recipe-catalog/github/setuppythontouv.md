# Replace `actions/setup-python` with `astral-sh/setup-uv`

**org.openrewrite.github.SetupPythonToUv**

Replace `actions/setup-python` action with `astral-sh/setup-uv` action for faster Python environment setup and dependency management.

**Benefits of UV:**
 - Significantly faster package installation and environment setup
 - Built-in dependency resolution and locking
 - Integrated caching for improved CI performance
 - Drop-in replacement for pip workflows

**Transformations applied:**
 - `actions/setup-python@v5` → `astral-sh/setup-uv@v6`
 - `cache: 'pip'` → `enable-cache: 'true'`
 - `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `uv sync` (configurable strategy)
 - `python -m <module>` → `uv run <module>`
 - Removes unnecessary `pip install --upgrade pip` steps

**Sync strategies:**
 - `basic`: Basic synchronization (`uv sync`)
 - `locked`: Use locked dependencies (`uv sync --locked`)
 - `full`: Install all extras and dev dependencies (`uv sync --all-extras --dev`)

See the [UV GitHub integration guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/integration/github/) for more details.

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | uvVersion | *Optional*. The version of the `astral-sh/setup-uv` action to use. Defaults to `v6`. | `v6` |
| `String` | syncStrategy | *Optional*. Strategy for the `uv sync` command replacement. Valid options: `basic`, `locked`, `full` | `locked` |
| `Boolean` | transformPipCommands | *Optional*. Whether to transform `pip install` commands to `uv` equivalents:<br />- `pip install -r requirements.txt` → `uv sync`<br />- `pip install .` → `uv sync`<br />- `python -m pytest` → `uv run pytest`<br /><br />When disabled, only the action itself is replaced. Defaults to `true`. | `true` |
| `Boolean` | enableCache | *Optional*. Whether to automatically convert `cache: 'pip'` to `enable-cache: 'true'` for UV's built-in caching. When disabled, cache settings are left unchanged. Defaults to `true`. | `true` |

## Example
