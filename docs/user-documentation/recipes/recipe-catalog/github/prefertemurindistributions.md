# Use `actions/setup-java` `temurin` distribution as they are cached in hosted runners

**org.openrewrite.github.PreferTemurinDistributions**

_[Host runners](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-github-hosted-runners/about-github-hosted-runners#supported-runners-and-hardware-resources/) include Temurin by default as part of the [hosted tool cache](https://github.com/actions/setup-java/blob/main/docs/advanced-usage.md#hosted-tool-cache). Using Temurin speeds up builds as there is no need to download and configure the Java SDK with every build._
