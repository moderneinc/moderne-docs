# Remove deprecated Freemarker `?html` built-in

**org.openrewrite.java.struts.migrate6.RemoveFreemarkerHtmlBuiltin**

_Removes the deprecated `?html` built-in from Freemarker templates. After migrating to Struts 6 with the latest Freemarker (which enables auto-escaping by default), the `?html` built-in is no longer needed and should be removed. See the [Struts 2.5 to 6.0 migration guide](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/WW/Struts+2.5+to+6.0.0+migration#Struts2.5to6.0.0migration-Tagescapebehaviour)._
