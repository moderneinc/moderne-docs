# Remove the `@Temporal` annotation for some `java.sql` attributes

**org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.RemoveTemporalAnnotation**

_OpenJPA persists the fields of attributes of type `java.sql.Date`, `java.sql.Time`, or `java.sql.Timestamp` that have a `javax.persistence.Temporal` annotation, whereas EclipseLink throws an exception. Remove the `@Temporal` annotation so the behavior in EclipseLink will match the behavior in OpenJPA._
