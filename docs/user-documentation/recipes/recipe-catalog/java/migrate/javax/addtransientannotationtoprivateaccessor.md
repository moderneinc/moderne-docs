# Private accessor methods must have a `@Transient` annotation

**org.openrewrite.java.migrate.javax.AddTransientAnnotationToPrivateAccessor**

_According to the JPA 2.1 specification, when property access is used, the property accessor methods must be public or protected. OpenJPA ignores any private accessor methods, whereas EclipseLink persists those attributes. To ignore private accessor methods in EclipseLink, the methods must have a `@Transient` annotation._
