# Replace `com.sun.awt.AWTUtilities` static method invocations

**org.openrewrite.java.migrate.ReplaceComSunAWTUtilitiesMethods**

_This recipe replaces several static calls  in `com.sun.awt.AWTUtilities` with the JavaSE 11 equivalent. The methods replaced are `AWTUtilities.isTranslucencySupported()`, `AWTUtilities.setWindowOpacity()`, `AWTUtilities.getWindowOpacity()`, `AWTUtilities.getWindowShape()`, `AWTUtilities.isWindowOpaque()`, `AWTUtilities.isTranslucencyCapable()` and `AWTUtilities.setComponentMixingCutoutShape()`._
