# Simplify catch clauses for Jackson exceptions

**org.openrewrite.java.jackson.SimplifyJacksonExceptionCatch**

_In Jackson 3, `JacksonException` and its subtypes extend `RuntimeException`. This recipe simplifies multi-catch clauses by removing Jackson exception types when `RuntimeException` is also caught, since catching both is redundant. For example, `catch (JacksonException | RuntimeException e)` becomes `catch (RuntimeException e)`._
