# In Spring Boot 2.5 a `DefaultConfigurationCustomizer` can now be used in favour of defining one or more `*Provider` beans

**org.openrewrite.java.spring.boot2.search.CustomizingJooqDefaultConfiguration**

_To streamline the customization of jOOQ’s `DefaultConfiguration`, a bean that implements `DefaultConfigurationCustomizer` can now be defined. This customizer callback should be used in favour of defining one or more `*Provider` beans, the support for which has now been deprecated. See [Spring Boot 2.5 jOOQ customization](https://docs.spring.io/spring-boot/docs/2.5.x/reference/htmlsingle/#features.sql.jooq.customizing)._
