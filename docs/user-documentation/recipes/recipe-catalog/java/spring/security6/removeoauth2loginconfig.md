# Remove unneeded `oauth2Login` config when upgrading to Spring Security 6

**org.openrewrite.java.spring.security6.RemoveOauth2LoginConfig**

_`oauth2Login()` is a Spring Security feature that allows users to authenticate with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider. When a user is authenticated using this feature, they are granted a set of authorities that determines what actions they are allowed to perform within the application.  In Spring Security 5, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 or OpenID Connect 1.0 provider via `oauth2Login()` is `ROLE_USER`. This means that the user is allowed to access the application's resources as a regular user.  However, in Spring Security 6, the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OAuth2 provider is `OAUTH2_USER`, and the default authority given to a user authenticated with an OpenID Connect 1.0 provider is `OIDC_USER`. These authorities are more specific and allow for better customization of the user's permissions within the application.  If you are upgrading to Spring Security 6 and you have previously configured a `GrantedAuthoritiesMapper` to handle the authorities of users authenticated via `oauth2Login()`, you can remove it completely as the new default authorities should be sufficient._
