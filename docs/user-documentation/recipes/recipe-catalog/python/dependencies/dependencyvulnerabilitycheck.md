# Find and fix vulnerable PyPI dependencies

**org.openrewrite.python.dependencies.DependencyVulnerabilityCheck**

_This software composition analysis (SCA) tool detects and upgrades dependencies with publicly disclosed vulnerabilities. This recipe both generates a report of vulnerable dependencies and upgrades to newer versions with fixes. This recipe by default only upgrades to the latest **patch** version. If a minor or major upgrade is required to reach the fixed version, this can be controlled using the `maximumUpgradeDelta` option. Vulnerability information comes from the [GitHub Security Advisory Database](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/global-security-advisories/about-the-github-advisory-database), which aggregates vulnerability data from several public databases, including the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) maintained by the United States government. Dependencies following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) will see their _patch_ version updated where applicable._

## Recipe source

This recipe is only available to users of [Moderne](https://docs.moderne.io/).


This recipe is available under the [Moderne Proprietary License](https://docs.moderne.io/licensing/overview).

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `Boolean` | addMarkers | *Optional*. Report each vulnerability as search result markers. When enabled you can see which dependencies are bringing in vulnerable transitives in the diff view. By default these markers are omitted, making it easier to see version upgrades within the diff. |  |
| `UpgradeDelta` | maximumUpgradeDelta | *Optional*. The maximum difference to allow when suggesting a dependency version upgrade. Use `none` to only report vulnerabilities without making any changes. Patch version upgrades are the default and safest option, as patch releases assert full backwards compatibility with no breaking changes. Minor version upgrades can introduce new features but do not _typically_ include breaking changes. Major version upgrades will typically require code changes above and beyond this recipe.  Valid options: `none`, `patch`, `minor`, `major` | `patch` |
| `String` | minimumSeverity | *Optional*. Only fix vulnerabilities with a severity level equal to or higher than the specified minimum. Vulnerabilities are classified as low, moderate, high, or critical based on their potential impact. Default is `low`, which includes all severity levels. Valid options: `low`, `moderate`, `high`, `critical` | `moderate` |
| `String` | cvePattern | *Optional*. Only fix vulnerabilities matching this regular expression pattern. This allows filtering to specific CVEs or CVE ranges. For example, `CVE-2023-.*` will only check for CVEs from 2023, `CVE-(2022\|2023)-.*` will check for CVEs from 2022 or 2023, `CVE-2021-44228\|CVE-2022-23305` will check for those specific CVEs. If not specified, all CVEs will be checked (subject to other filters). | `CVE-2023-.*` |

### Vulnerability report
**org.openrewrite.python.dependencies.table.VulnerabilityReport**

_A vulnerability report that includes detailed information about the affected artifact and the corresponding CVEs._

| Column Name | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| CVE | The CVE number. |
| Package name | The package name. |
| Version | The resolved version. |
| Fixed in version | The minimum version that is no longer vulnerable. |
| Fixable with version update only | Whether the vulnerability is likely to be fixed by increasing the dependency version only, with no code modifications required. This is a heuristic which assumes that the dependency is accurately versioned according to [semver](https://semver.org/). |
| Summary | The summary of the CVE. |
| Base score | The calculated base score. |
| Depth | Zero for direct dependencies. |
| CWEs | Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) identifiers; semicolon separated. |
