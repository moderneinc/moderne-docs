# Find Python files that import a module

**org.openrewrite.python.search.UsesImport**

_Marks Python source files that import the given module, matching the as-written import path rather than type attribution. Robust to type-checker canonicalization and to removed or unresolvable symbols, which makes it usable as a precondition for import-migration recipes where `HasType` would miss the file._
