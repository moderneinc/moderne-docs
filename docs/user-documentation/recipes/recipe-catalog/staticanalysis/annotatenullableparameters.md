# Annotate null-checked method parameters with `@Nullable`

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.AnnotateNullableParameters**

_Add `@Nullable` to parameters of public methods that are explicitly checked for `null`. By default `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` is used, but through the `nullableAnnotationClass` option a custom annotation can be provided. When providing a custom `nullableAnnotationClass` that annotation should be meta annotated with `@Target(TYPE_USE)`. This recipe scans for methods that do not already have parameters annotated with `@Nullable` annotation and checks their usages for potential null checks. Additional null-checking methods can be specified via the `additionalNullCheckingMethods` option._

## Options

| Type | Name | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `String` | nullableAnnotationClass | *Optional*. The fully qualified name of the @Nullable annotation. The annotation should be meta annotated with `@Target(TYPE_USE)`. Defaults to `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` | `org.jspecify.annotations.Nullable` |
| `List` | additionalNullCheckingMethods | *Optional*. A list of method patterns (in OpenRewrite MethodMatcher format) that should be considered as null-checking methods. These will be added to the built-in list of known null-checking methods. Use `..` for any parameters, e.g., `com.mycompany.utils.StringUtil isEmpty(..)` or `com.mycompany.utils.CollectionUtil isNullOrEmpty(java.util.Collection)` | `com.mycompany.utils.StringUtil isEmpty(..), com.mycompany.utils.CollectionUtil isNullOrEmpty(..)` |
