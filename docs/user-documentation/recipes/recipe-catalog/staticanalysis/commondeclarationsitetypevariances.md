# Properly use declaration-site type variance for well-known types

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.CommonDeclarationSiteTypeVariances**

_When using a method parameter like `Function<IN, OUT>`, it should rather be `Function<? super IN, ? extends OUT>`. This recipe checks for method parameters of well-known types._
