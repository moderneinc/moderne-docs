# Unnecessary throws

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.UnnecessaryThrows**

Remove unnecessary `throws` declarations. This recipe will only remove unused, checked exceptions if:

 - The declaring class or the method declaration is `final`.
 - The method declaration is `static` or `private`.
 - The method overrides a method declaration in a super class and the super class does not throw the exception.
 - The method is `public` or `protected` and the exception is not documented via a JavaDoc as a `@throws` tag.
