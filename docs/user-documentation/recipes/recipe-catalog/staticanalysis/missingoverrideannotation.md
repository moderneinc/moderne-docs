# Add missing `@Override` to overriding and implementing methods

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.MissingOverrideAnnotation**

_Adds `@Override` to methods overriding superclass methods or implementing interface methods. Annotating methods improves readability by showing the author's intent to override. Additionally, when annotated, the compiler will emit an error when a signature of the overridden method does not match the superclass method._
