# Remove `toString()` calls on arrays

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.RemoveToStringCallsFromArrayInstances**

_The result from `toString()` calls on arrays is largely useless. The output does not actually reflect the contents of the array. `Arrays.toString(array)` should be used instead as it gives the contents of the array._
