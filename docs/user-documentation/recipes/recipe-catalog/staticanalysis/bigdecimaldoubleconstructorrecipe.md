# `new BigDecimal(double)` should not be used

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.BigDecimalDoubleConstructorRecipe**

_Use of `new BigDecimal(double)` constructor can lead to loss of precision. Use `BigDecimal.valueOf(double)` instead. For example writing `new BigDecimal(0.1)` does not create a `BigDecimal` which is exactly equal to `0.1`, but it is equal to `0.1000000000000000055511151231257827021181583404541015625`. This is because `0.1` cannot be represented exactly as a double (or, for that matter, as a binary fraction of any finite length)._
