# Use Empty Array for `Collection.toArray()`

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.ReplaceCollectionToArrayArgWithEmptyArray**

```
Changes new array creation with `Collection#toArray(T[])` to use an empty array argument, which is better for performance.

According to the `Collection#toArray(T[])` documentation:

> If the collection fits in the specified array, it is returned therein.

However, although it's not intuitive, allocating a right-sized array ahead of time to pass to the API appears to be [generally worse for performance](https://shipilev.net/blog/2016/arrays-wisdom-ancients/#_conclusion) according to benchmarking and JVM developers due to a number of implementation details in both Java and the virtual machine.

H2 achieved significant performance gains by [switching to empty arrays instead pre-sized ones](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/issues/311).
```
