# Rename methods named `hashcode`, `equal`, or `tostring`

**org.openrewrite.staticanalysis.RenameMethodsNamedHashcodeEqualOrToString**

_Methods should not be named `hashcode`, `equal`, or `tostring`. Any of these are confusing as they appear to be intended as overridden methods from the `Object` base class, despite being case-insensitive._
