###### Before
```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;

class A {
    void divide() {
        BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(10);
        BigDecimal bd2 = BigDecimal.valueOf(2);
        BigDecimal bd3 = bd.divide(bd2, BigDecimal.ROUND_DOWN);
        bd.divide(bd2, 1);
        bd.divide(bd2, 1, BigDecimal.ROUND_CEILING);
        bd.divide(bd2, 1, 1);
        bd.setScale(2, 1);
    }
}
```

###### After
```java
import java.math.BigDecimal;
import java.math.RoundingMode;

class A {
    void divide() {
        BigDecimal bd = BigDecimal.valueOf(10);
        BigDecimal bd2 = BigDecimal.valueOf(2);
        BigDecimal bd3 = bd.divide(bd2, RoundingMode.DOWN);
        bd.divide(bd2, RoundingMode.DOWN);
        bd.divide(bd2, 1, RoundingMode.CEILING);
        bd.divide(bd2, 1, RoundingMode.DOWN);
        bd.setScale(2, RoundingMode.DOWN);
    }
